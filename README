Sketches in the ContextFree graphical language.
March 3, 2012

I first started playing around with the ContextFree software and language in 2009 after it was featured in Make: Magazine Issue 17.  My interest was renewed recently after deciding to make generative computer art for the office as part of a Do What You Want Day project.

This repository is used to house my sketches in ContextFree.
